Send Mail with files With asp.net c# 
By Aamir siddique OF programmingnation

Send mails with asp.net c# From code behind.

#NOTE#
If You are unable to send email from gmail server .it will probably be google's new security protocol
for that enable 2 step verification in your google account and generate an app password for mail/windows computer that will do it
 else just enable less secure app access in security(but it gets disabled automatically if not used regularly)
